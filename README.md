# GB-BASIC
GB-BASIC is a BASIC interpreter written in Rust. Currently, GB-BASIC is a work in progress. The goal for V1.0 is to cover all the TinyBASIC features. Ultimately, I'd like to implement the full QBASIC feature set.

## Personal motivation
My grandpa is a tech enthusiast and he used to write programs in QBASIC and Assembly both for work and leisure. Recently, he told me that he would like to play around with QBASIC again. I thought it would be a fun project to write a BASIC interpreter that he could use to run his old programs and write new ones. The project is indeed named after him: G.B. are his initials.
