# Tiny BASIC
A Tiny BASIC interpreter written in Rust. The interpreter is based on the Tiny BASIC [specification](http://www.ittybittycomputers.com/ittybitty/tinybasic/TBuserMan.txt) from the 1970s.

## Personal motivation
My grandpa is a tech enthusiast and he used to write programs in QBASIC and Assembly both for work and leisure. Recently, he told me that he would like to play around with BASIC again. I thought it would be a fun project to write a BASIC interpreter for him.
